<br> Advantages:

<ul>
    <li><b>Memoization</b><br>
        <small><small>Caches results from previous function calls.</small></small>
    </li>

    <li><b>Idempotence</b><br>
        <small><small>Same results regardless how many times you call a function</small></small>
    </li>

    <li><b>Modularization</b><br>
        <small><small>We have no state that pervades the whole code, so we build our project with small, black-boxed components.
            This promotes bottom-up programming</small></small>
    </li>

    <li><b>Ease of debugging</b><br>
        <small><small>Functions are isolated, they only depend on their input and their output, so they are very easy to reason about</small></small>
    </li>

    <li><b>Parallelization</b><br>
        <small>
            <small>Function calls are independent. We can parallelize them in different process/CPUs/nodes etc</small>
        </small>
    </li>
