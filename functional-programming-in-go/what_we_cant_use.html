                Monads enable pure functional programmers to implement mutation, state, I/O, and a plethora of other things that are not functions.

            <small>The Hindley-Milner type inference is used for Hindley-Milner type systems, a restriction of System-F
                type systems. The interesting feature of HM type systems is that they have parametric polymorphism (aka.

                That is the single biggest type system feature that Go refuses to have.</small>
