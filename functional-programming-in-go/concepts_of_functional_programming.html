        <b>First class and high-order functions</b> <br>
        <small>
            <small>Higher-order functions are functions that can either take other functions as arguments or return them as results.

    <li>
        <b>Pure functions</b> <br>
        <small>
            <small>Pure functions (or expressions) have no side effects (memory or I/O).

    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Recursion</b> <br>
        <small>
            <small>Recursive functions invoke themselves, allowing an operation to be performed
            over and over until the base case is reached.

        <b>Type systems</b> <br>
        <small>
            <small>The use of algebraic datatypes makes manipulation of complex data structures convenient; the presence of
            strong compile-time type checking makes programs more reliable in absence of other reliability techniques like
            test-driven development, while type inference frees the programmer from the need to manually declare types to
            the compiler in most cases.

    <li>
        <b>Referental transparency</b> <br>
        <small>
            <small>Functional programs do not have assignment statements, that is, the value of a variable in a
                functional program never changes once defined.
